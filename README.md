# Data_processing

This was created for my Thesis reasearch purpose.To process the data efficiently for input for machine learning algos.

Data is collected in CSV format for each analysis(malware/clean).
Two folders - Clean
            -Malware
Each "xlsx" file conatins 19 unique parameters

Each folder contains ~1000 "xlsx" files.

-combines clean and malware analysis normalized data in on file for processing
-arranges all files in specifc folders.
